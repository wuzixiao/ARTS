I've been thinkg this problem for a couple of days without a good solution. I thought there should be a way to divide the array with the min of max sum of subarray. 

Actually, the solution is to try with a number which is between A.Sum() and A.Max() to test the condition. If the condition is satisfiedï¼Œtrying with a smaller one until the min found.

```c#
        private int getBlocks(int[] A, int mid)
        {
            var blocks = 1;
            var curSum = 0;
            foreach(var a in A)
            {
                if(curSum+a > mid)
                {
                    blocks += 1;
                    curSum = a; //the first element of next block is a
                }
                else
                {
                    curSum += a;
                }
            }

            return blocks;
        }

        public int MinMaxDivision(int K, int M, int[] A)
        {
            int max = A.Sum();
            int min = A.Max();
            while (min < max)
            {
                var mid = (min + max) / 2;
                var blocks = getBlocks(A, mid);
                if (blocks > K)
                {
                    min = mid+1;
                }
                else 
                { 
                    max = mid;
                }
            }

            return min;
        }
    }
```
