I think this problem for a couple of days without a good solution. Because I thought I must find a way to divide the array with the min of max sum of subarray. 

Actually, the solution is to try with a number with is between A.Sum() and A.Max() to test the condition. If the condition is satisfiedï¼Œtrying with a smaller one until the min found.
