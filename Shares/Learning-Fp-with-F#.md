# Learn Fp with F# (1)

Last week, I went to the [Functional Programming Auckland]([https://www.meetup.com/Functional-Programming-Auckland/events/260393159/](https://www.meetup.com/Functional-Programming-Auckland/events/260393159/)) meetup for the first time. It was much better than I thought. I meet some great people, especially Sam who was the turtor of that event. 

Before going to that meetup, I knew a little bit about Haskell, but never use it to write a function more than 5 lines, and I never used F# before. Since I am on the boat of .net, it would be great if I can get some knowledgement of F#
