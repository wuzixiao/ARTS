# Learn Fp with F# (1)

Last week, I went to the [Functional Programming Auckland]([https://www.meetup.com/Functional-Programming-Auckland/events/260393159/](https://www.meetup.com/Functional-Programming-Auckland/events/260393159/)) meetup for the first time. It was much better than I thought. I meet some great people, especially Sam who was the turtor of that event. 

Before going to that meetup, I knew a little bit about Haskell, but never use it to write a function more than 5 lines, and I never used F# before. Since I am on the boat of .net, it would be great if I can g some knowledgement of F# and use it in work hopefully.

In the middle break of the meetup, I asked Sam how did you convince your manager to allow you to use F# in the project, as he mentioned it was a C# project. His answer is quite understandable, "very carefully", he spent around 2 years to adv FP in his work and in the end he used it without any permission. What a brave man!

It made me think why Fp is so attractive to him and many other developers?
