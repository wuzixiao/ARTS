# Learn Fp with F# (1)

Last week, I went to the [Functional Programming Auckland]([https://www.meetup.com/Functional-Programming-Auckland/events/260393159/](https://www.meetup.com/Functional-Programming-Auckland/events/260393159/)) meetup for the first time. It was much better than I thought. I meet some great people, especially Sam who was the turtor of that event. 

Before going to that meetup, I knew a little bit about Haskell, but never use it to write a function more than 5 lines, and I never used F# before. Since I am on the boat of .net, it would be great if I can g some knowledgement of F# and use it in work hopefully.

In the middle break of the meetup, I asked Sam how did you convince your manager to allow you to use F# in the project, as he mentioned it was a C# project. His answer is quite understandable, "very carefully", he spent around 2 years to adv FP in his work and in the end he used it without any permission. What a brave man!

It made me think why Fp is so attractive to him and many other developers?

>  * Function is immultable. 
> * Code is a proved programme. Only need to write a few extreme test cases.
> * Type is F# makes more sense, like Null, boolean etc. 
> * Code of Fp is statement; Code in OO is expression.
> * Fp is suitable for programme that has complex business logic.

In the class, he talked about Map, Functor patterns, I didn't fully follow him. I will dig them more later. And some other topics I am interested in

* How Fp deal with I/O?
* What is design pattern in Fp?
* What other patterns besides Map, Functor?
