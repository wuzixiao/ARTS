# A writing tool -- StackEdit

One day I was looking for a mark down editor. Google recommended an online tool: https://stackedit.io/

I found it is open source and very powerful:

* Support basic mark down grammar.
* Provide externtions of markdown.
    * Table format support
    * You can render LaTex using Katex
    * UML diagram
* It is an online tool, but it supports using **offline**
* Integrate with multiple cloud platform like: Google Drive, Dropbox, Github, you can edit the file and save directly on the cloud drive.

Cannot wait to use it!!
