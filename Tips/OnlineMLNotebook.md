# Online ML notebook

I use Google's notebook in the course of Tensorflow on coursera. The url is https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb
There is a simple introduction on the page. There are some other settings in the menu, like using which version of python, which type of processor.

I found it runs pretty fast with google's notebook. Microsoft has another one. https://notebooks.azure.com/. It supports more languages than any other platform including Python 2, Python 3, R, and F#.
If you want to use F# or R, using the azure is good otherwise, just use colab.research.google.com.
